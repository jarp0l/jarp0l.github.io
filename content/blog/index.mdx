Welcome to my blog!

This is yet another attempt at achieving a layout that feels satisfying. I've tried a few different
approaches in the past, but something always seemed to be missing. I wanted to create both a
knowledge base and a blog, and I believe I've achieved that with this setup, all while maintaining a
clean design, thanks to Fumadocs.

This setup still needs some work, but I'm happy with what I have so far. One thing I want to improve
is the search functionality. I couldn't get the search to work across both the knowledge base and
blog posts together, so I ended up with a little hack: if you check `/app/layout.tsx`, you'll see that
I'm using client-side rendering to search through the blog posts. This means that when rendered
server-side, it defaults to searching the knowledge base, but when rendered client-side, it searches
both the blog posts and the knowledge base.

## TO-DO

- [ ] Populate this page with blog posts sorted in chronological order.
- [ ] Figure out how to make the search work with both knowledge base and blog posts at the same
      time.

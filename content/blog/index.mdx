Welcome to my blog!

This is yet another attempt at achieving a layout that feels satisfying. I've tried a few different
approaches in the past, but something always seemed to be missing. I wanted to create both a
knowledge base and a blog, and I believe I've achieved that with this setup, all while maintaining a
clean design, thanks to Fumadocs.

This setup still needs some work, but I'm happy with what I have so far.

## TO-DO

- [x] Populate this page with blog posts sorted in chronological order.
- [x] Figure out how to make the search work with both knowledge base and blog posts at the same
      time.
- [ ] Add RSS feed.

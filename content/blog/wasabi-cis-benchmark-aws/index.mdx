title: Wasabi security review using the AWS CIS Benchmark
description:
  Leveraging the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark to fill the gap in Wasabi security assessment
  standards.

A few months ago, I had to perform a security review of a Wasabi environment. Having done something
similar in AWS, I knew that having a reference for best practices would help a lot. But I could not
find anything back then, besides the sparse information in Wasabi's docs. So the idea of adapting
the AWS CIS Benchmark
([CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services)) struck
me, as there are similarities in the APIs and features offered by Wasabi for cloud storage and
Identity and Access Management (IAM). The benchmark for AWS was at v4.0.0 during the time of my
assessment, so my post follows this version exclusively, although it's at v6.0.0 as of today.

Here's some good information about CIS Benchmarks from AWS:
[What are CIS Benchmarks?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cis-benchmarks)

## Wasabi

[Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/) is a cloud storage service that provides an AWS S3-compatible storage
API. It offers a simple and cost-effective solution for storing data in the cloud.

The Wasabi Cloud Object Storage service and its IAM service have similarities with that of AWS, and
we can pick certain controls from the CIS Benchmark and adapt it for Wasabi.

## Summary of recommendations

As I mentioned, we can pick certain controls related to AWS S3, IAM and logging, and adapt them for
Wasabi. The table below is a summary of such controls:

**Summary of recommendations based on CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v4.0.0**:

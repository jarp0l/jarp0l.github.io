  can apply the same approach to any other AWS API.

A StackOverflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/79418692/13742919) asked how to list the
users in the AWS Identity Store using Postman. They tried to call the API in a similar way to
calling AWS IAM APIs, but it didn't work. Since I was already working with Identity Center, I saw
this as an opportunity to dive deeper into how it works and decided to give it a shot.

This indeed turned out to be an interesting exercise. The documentation covered operations and
request parameters well, but it lacked concrete examples and didn't provide an endpoint URL for the
Identity Store, unlike IAM (see
[this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html#API_ListUsers_Examples)
for example). That's what made it interesting.

So I found Nick Frichette's blog post on
[A Look at AWS API Protocols](https://frichetten.com/blog/aws-api-protocols/). Nick doesn't cover
the Identity Center or Identity Store API, but he explains how AWS API requests are structured based
on different protocols in his blog. As he points out in the blog, all of this can be found in the
AWS SDK codebases. That was my starting point to understand how `<insert-a-service>` API works —
with the help of AWS SDKs!

<Callout title="AWS IAM Identity Center vs Identity Store" type="info">
  Identity Center is a service for managing user access across multiple AWS accounts and
  applications. It provides a central place to define users, groups and permissions. <br />
  Identity Store is what Identity Center uses to store identities or principals (i.e. users and groups)
  information. <br />
  For this blog, we'll focus on the Identity Store API, as it contains operations related to users
  and groups.
</Callout>

## AWS SDKs

AWS SDKs are one of the best places to start when exploring how AWS APIs work, although,
technically, the API reference/docs should probably come first.

AWS SDKs come in different flavors: Python, Go, JavaScript, etc. I chose to look at
[Botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore) — which sits under the hood of Boto3 (Python SDK) and
the AWS CLI — to understand how the Identity Center API works.

## Botocore - Identity Store API

I'll use the Identity Store API as an example to show how you can find the information you need to
call an AWS API in `<any-http-client>`.

Here's a summary from my SO answer:

### Summary

To list users from AWS IAM Identity Center, you need to use the region-specific Identity Store API
URL. This is different from how you list users in IAM.

Unlike IAM, it uses POST request with a JSON body and the request syntax looks like this (assuming
you have set the authorization headers for AWS correctly, e.g. for
[Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/aws-signature/), or
directly go to the AWS docs for information on signing API requests:
[Signing AWS API requests.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html)):

Request syntax:

```bash
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: identitystore.${identity_center_region}.amazonaws.com
Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1
X-Amz-Target: AWSIdentityStore.ListUsers
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=ASIAEXAMPLEEXAMPLEEX/20250319/${identity_center_region}/identitystore/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date;x-amz-security-token;x-amz-target, Signature=...

{
  "IdentityStoreId": "${identity_store_id}"
}
```

Replace `${identity_center_region}` with the region corresponding to your Identity Store ID (e.g.
`us-east-1`) and replace `${identity_store_id}` with the Identity Store ID (e.g. `d-1234567890`).

### How do you find this?

To construct an API request for Identity Store, you can refer to the following lines/snippets from
Botocore's codebase:

#### 1\. For endpoint URL

The Identity Store API's endpoint URL is defined in
[Botocore's endpoint rule set](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/976b8947a746663232ab8886e7224b33d862c09e/botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/endpoint-rule-set-1.json#L244):

```json title="botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/endpoint-rule-set-1.json"
"endpoint": {
    "url": "https://identitystore.{Region}.amazonaws.com",  // [!code highlight]
    "properties": {},
    "headers": {}
},
```

#### 2\. For request headers

You can check the
[serialization logic for JSON](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/976b8947a746663232ab8886e7224b33d862c09e/botocore/serialize.py#L345-L372)
for the expected request headers:

```py title="botocore/serialize.py"
serialized['headers'] = {
    'X-Amz-Target': target,
    'Content-Type': f'application/x-amz-json-{json_version}',
}
```

#### 3\. For request format

The
[service definition file](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/976b8947a746663232ab8886e7224b33d862c09e/botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/service-2.json)
provides metadata about the
[request format](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/976b8947a746663232ab8886e7224b33d862c09e/botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/service-2.json#L3-L15)
and
[operation](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/976b8947a746663232ab8886e7224b33d862c09e/botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/service-2.json#L301-L306):

```json title="botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/service-2.json"
"metadata": {
    "apiVersion": "2020-06-15",
    "endpointPrefix": "identitystore",  // [!code highlight]
    "jsonVersion": "1.1",   // [!code highlight]
    "protocol": "json", // [!code highlight]
    "serviceAbbreviation": "IdentityStore",
    "serviceFullName": "AWS SSO Identity Store",
    "serviceId": "identitystore",
    "signatureVersion": "v4",   // [!code highlight]
    "signingName": "identitystore",
    "targetPrefix": "AWSIdentityStore",  // [!code highlight]
    "uid": "identitystore-2020-06-15"
},
```

The `ListUsers` operation is defined with its HTTP method and path:

```json title="botocore/data/identitystore/2020-06-15/service-2.json"
"ListUsers": {
    "name": "ListUsers",
    "http": {
        "method": "POST",
        "requestUri": "/"
    }
}
```

So here's how we derive the request headers in this case:

```bash
Content-Type: ${protocol}-${jsonVersion}
X-Amz-Target: ${targetPrefix}.${operations.name}
```

Substitute the placeholders with the values:

```bash
Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1
X-Amz-Target: AWSIdentityStore.ListUsers
```

Combine all the pieces and you have everything needed to construct the final request in
`<any-http-client>`. Here's an example using Postman:
